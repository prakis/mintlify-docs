title: "Queue"
description: "A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means the first element added is the first one to be removed."

### Analogy: People in a Line

Think of a queue at:

- A bus stop
- A ticket counter
- A fast food restaurant

The **first person to arrive** is the **first to be served**, and **new people join at the end** of the line.

In a queue data structure, the first element added is the first one to be removed. Thatâ€™s how a queue works in programming too.

**The main operations on a queue are:**

- **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the back (or "rear") of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Removes the element from the front of the queue.

```python
from collections import deque

# Create an empty queue
queue = deque()

# Enqueue (add to end)
queue.append("Task 1")
queue.append("Task 2")
queue.append("Task 3")

print("Queue:", queue)

# Dequeue (remove from front)
first_task = queue.popleft()
print("Dequeued:", first_task)
print("Queue after dequeue:", queue)
```

| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Print Queue**            | Documents are printed in the order they were added          |
| **Task Scheduling**        | OS or threads manage jobs/tasks using queues                |
| **Call Center Systems**    | Incoming calls are held in a queue                          |
| **Data Streaming**         | Real-time processing of messages/events                     |
| **Keyboard/Input Buffers** | Characters typed by users are stored and processed in order |
