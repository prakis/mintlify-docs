title: "Graph"
description: "A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that connect them.  Unlike a tree, which has a hierarchical structure, a graph can have any number of connections between nodes, including cycles (where you can return to a starting node by following the edges)."

Imagine you have a map where:

- Each **city** is a **node**.
- Each **road** between cities is an **edge**.
- If the road is one-way, it's a **directed edge**.
- Distance of the road can be it's **weight**.

You could represent this graph as

```
City-A ---10km---> City-B
City-A ---5km---> City-C
City-B ---7km---> City-C
```

This graph helps answer questions like:

- Whatâ€™s the shortest path from City-A to City-C?
- Which cities can you reach from a starting point?

### **Key Concepts**

A **graph** is a data structure that consists of Nodes(Vertex) and Edges.

- **Vertex (Node)**: A fundamental unit of the graph. It can hold data or simply represent a point.
- **Edge**: A connection between two vertices. Edges can be **directed** (pointing from one vertex to another, like a one-way street) or **undirected** (bidirectional, like a two-way street).
- **Path**: A sequence of vertices connected by edges.
- **Cycle**: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
- **Weighted Graph**: A graph where each edge has a numerical value (a "weight" or "cost") associated with it, often representing distance, time, or cost.

### Common Real-World Examples:

- **Social Networks**: Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are a perfect example. Each person is a **vertex**, and the friendships or followings are **edges**. This structure allows for analyzing social connections, finding mutual friends, and suggesting new connections.
- **Navigation and GPS**: GPS systems use graphs to represent road networks. Cities or intersections are **vertices**, and the roads connecting them are **edges**. The weight of each edge can be the distance or travel time, allowing algorithms like Dijkstra's to find the shortest or fastest route.
- **The Internet**: The World Wide Web itself can be viewed as a graph, where webpages are **vertices** and the hyperlinks between them are **directed edges**. Search engines use this graph structure to rank webpages based on their connections and importance.
- **Circuit Design**: In electrical engineering, graphs can model circuits. Components are **vertices**, and the wires connecting them are **edges**. This helps in analyzing circuit flow and identifying potential design flaws.
- **Flight networks**: Airports as nodes, flights as edges with weights (price, duration).
