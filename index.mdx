title: "What are Data Structures?"
description: "A data structure is a way of organizing and storing digital data so that it can be used efficiently. Just like physical storage methods (like shelves, drawers, or filing cabinets) help us manage physical objects, data structures help us manage digital data.  "

Now, imagine if data structures were not just a concept in computers, but part of nature itself. In fact, they are — **DNA is nature’s most powerful and compact data structure.**

Understanding DNA as a data structure shows how **fundamental and universal** the idea of structured data is:

- DNA isn't just random molecules; it's structured, ordered, and interpretable — just like a well-designed tree or graph in software.
- Biology uses **compression, redundancy, and error correction** — concepts mirrored in computer science.

So, just like **a tree can represent a file system**, or **a hash map can represent a lookup table**, DNA represents **a living blueprint**, encoded with information and optimized through evolution.

**Data structures are not just tools of code — they are patterns of order.** Whether in computers or in the cells of your body, they shape how information is stored, understood, and passed on.

### <u>What they define</u>

**Data structures define and designed for a specific use case:**

- **How data is arranged** (e.g., in a line, a tree, a grid, etc.)
- **How data is accessed** (e.g., directly, sequentially, by key, etc.)
- **How efficiently data can be searched, inserted, deleted, or updated**

**Common data structures include:**

- [**Arrays**](/common-ds/arrays)
- [Linked lists](/common-ds/linkedlists)
- [**Stacks**](/common-ds/stacks)
- [**Queues**](/common-ds/queues)
- [**Trees**](/common-ds/trees)
- [**Graphs**](/common-ds/graphs)
- [**Hash maps**](/common-ds/hashmaps)
- [**Heaps**](/common-ds/heaps)

Each data structure is designed for a specific problem.
