**Analogy:** Imagine a treasure hunt where each clue tells you where to find the next clue. You can't just skip to the end; you must follow the clues in order.

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element, called a **node**, contains two parts:

1. **Data**: The actual value stored in the node.
2. **Next**: A link, or call it a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

Unlike arrays, linked lists don’t store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node "points" to the next, forming a **chain**.

The list starts with a **head** node, which is the first node. The last node in the list points to `None`, signifying the end of the list.

Unlike an array, you can't access an element in a linked list by its index (e.g., `list[3]`). To find an element, you must traverse the list from the `head` node, following the `next` pointers until you reach the desired node.

Think of a slideshow where each slide has a **"Next"** button to go to the following slide. You can only move **one step at a time**, from the current slide to the next.

This is very similar to a **linked list**:

- Each **slide** is like a **node**.
- The **"Next"** button acts like a **pointer (slide-id)** to the next node.
- The **first slide** is the **head** of the list.
- The **last slide** doesn’t link to any other, tail or null .
- If there's a **"Previous"** button, it's like a **doubly linked list**.

### Use Cases

1. **Implementing other data structures:** Linked lists are the building blocks for more complex data structures like stacks, queues, and hash maps.
2. **Dynamic memory allocation:** They are efficient for scenarios where you don't know the size of the data in advance, as they can grow or shrink dynamically.
3. **Managing a playlist:** A music playlist is a great example. You can easily add a new song to the end or remove a song from the middle without shifting the entire list of songs.
