description: "A tree is a non-linear, hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges."

A **Tree** is a **non-linear hierarchical** data structure made up of nodes connected by edges.\
It starts with a special node called the **root**, and each node can have **child nodes**, forming a branching structure â€” like an upside-down tree.

It's called a "tree" because it visually resembles an upside-down tree, with a single **root** node at the top and branches that spread downwards to other nodes, called **children**.

### Key Concepts

- **Root**: The topmost node (A tree has only one root node)
- **Parent**: A node that has child nodes
- **Child**: A node that descends from another node (parent)
- **Leaf**: A node that has no children
- **Edge**: The connection between nodes

### Use Cases

Trees are incredibly useful for organizing and managing hierarchical data efficiently.

1. **File Systems**: The directory structure on your computer (folders and files) is a classic example of a tree. The root directory is the top-level node, and subdirectories and files are its children.
2. **Databases**: B-trees and B\+ trees are specialized tree structures used in database systems to index data, allowing for fast searches, insertions, and deletions.
3. **Syntax Parsing**: Compilers use syntax trees to represent the structure of programming code, which helps in identifying errors and translating the code into machine-readable instructions.
4. **Family Trees:  **Ancestors and descendants in genealogy.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.children = []  # A list to hold the children nodes

    def add_child(self, child_node):
        self.children.append(child_node)

# Create the root node
root = TreeNode("Drinks")

# Create child nodes for the root
hot = TreeNode("Hot")
cold = TreeNode("Cold")

# Add the child nodes to the root
root.add_child(hot)
root.add_child(cold)

# Create grandchildren nodes
tea = TreeNode("Tea")
coffee = TreeNode("Coffee")
juice = TreeNode("Juice")
soda = TreeNode("Soda")

# Add the grandchildren to their respective parents
hot.add_child(tea)
hot.add_child(coffee)
cold.add_child(juice)
cold.add_child(soda)

# A simple function to traverse and print the tree structure
def print_tree(node, level=0):
    print("  " * level + "- " + node.data)
    for child in node.children:
        print_tree(child, level + 1)

print_tree(root)
```
